# Lama

![](./lama.jpg)

Synchronization and management of account states (transactions, balance, ...) across Blockchain protocols.

Main features of Lama are:
- Scalable and stateless components
- Event-driven architecture
- Account manager component for handling account metadata and sending sync event messages
- Easy support of new coin integration by having coin specific components:
  * Worker: fetching data from blockchain
  * Interpreter: computing and inserting data (operations, balance, ...)
  * Api: exposing http endpoints to get synced transactions, estimate fees, create and broadcast transactions

## How Lama works?

![](./excalidraw/lama-overview.png)

## Run lama components through docker

`docker-compose up`

Please have a look on `docker-compose.yml` file for more details on the configuration.

## Account manager

The account manager handles account registration and unregistration and emits events to the dedicated coin worker.
Please refer to the [account manager README][account-manager] for more details on how it works.

### Run through docker (recommended)

Install [docker][docker] then run `docker-compose up account-manager`.

This will create a PostgreSql, a RabbitMQ, a Redis and the latest published image of the lama account manager.

Please have a look on `docker-compose.yml` file for more details on the configuration.

#### Build and publish image in local

`sbt accountManager/docker:publishLocal`

### Run manually

Please refer to the [getting started][account-manager-getting-started] section of the account manager README.
